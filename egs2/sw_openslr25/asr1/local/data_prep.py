"""Prepare Kaldi-style data directories for the ALFFA Swahili broadcast-news corpus
(OpenSLR SLR25: https://www.openslr.org/25/).

The corpus ships pre-segmented train/test transcripts in Kaldi format
(wav.scp/text/utt2spk). We source the canonical, versioned copies of those small
metadata files from https://github.com/besacier/ALFFA_PUBLIC and bundle them under
local/metadata/ rather than re-deriving them from the OpenSLR tarball, since the
tarball's *audio* directory layout is not guaranteed to be stable across mirrors and
the shipped wav.scp paths are placeholders anyway (e.g. "/my_dir/wav/...").

Because of that, this script does not assume any particular internal directory
structure for the downloaded+extracted tarball: it indexes every .wav file under
--download_dir by filename and matches each utterance to its audio by basename. Any
utterance whose audio can't be found is dropped with a warning rather than failing
the whole run.

"Speaker" IDs in this corpus are broadcast recording sessions (e.g. SWH-05-20101106),
not individual talkers -- each session/show is one Kaldi "speaker". Since no official
dev split ships with the training audio (only train + test), we hold out two whole
train sessions (one from each of the corpus's two show families) as sw_dev, so no
recording leaks across the train/dev boundary.
